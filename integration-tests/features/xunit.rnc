#
# The following is a grammar in Relax NG Compact syntax for
# JUnit-compatible report files which sonar-cxx is able to import.
# Many test frameworks are able to generate output which is JUnit-compatible
# or at least, 'JUnit-inspirated'. The following grammar
# combines the flavors implemented by JUnit itself and Googletest.
#
# It can be used to validate xunit-reports, i.e. to determine, if
# a report is valid according to the expectations of sonar-cxx.
# It can be done as follows:
#
# $ rnv xunit.rnc <your xml report>
#
# rnv is a XML validator which can be obtained here:
