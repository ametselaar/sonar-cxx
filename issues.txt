- skipped tests for googletest          done
- success density                       done
- loop over testsuites
- move filename tag
- cleanup the unittest reports
- simple mode thing

Currently, I am in progress of validating the xunit-Feature,
i.e. writing integration tests, writing a grammar for the input format
etc. I have a couple of findings so far:

* As well the JUnit (version ...) as Googletest produce reports which
  begin with the tag 'testsuites'. TODO: what about nosetests?? The
  current implementation is able to consume it, because it ignores the
  root tag, just to the testssuite tag, iterates over all testcases
  and import them. Given a report with *multiple* testsuite-tags in
  it, it will *ignore* all but the first one.

  I think I will change this behaviour to a more sane one "loop over all
  testsuite-tags"

* We've introduced the filename attribute as a means to locate the test
  resources. Using this tag (and the knowledge which test resides in
  which file) one can augment the report putting such attributes
  holding paths to the right files into right places in the
  report. Now, it is only accepted in the testsuite-tag, which seems
  to be wrong, as at makes the assumption that all testcases
  belonging to the same testsuite reside in the same source
  file. Which is clearly wrong.

  I think we should change that.

* The XML samples used in the unit tests do not conform to the schema
  in full extend. Some dont use "testsuites" as root tag. Some contain
  attributes which neither JUnit nor Googletest produce.

  My plan is to correct those file to conform to the grammar.

Comments, ideas, objections?
